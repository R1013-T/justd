## Installation
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true }} items={['date-range-picker']}/>

<Installation options={{ isManual: true }} items={['react-aria-components', 'justd-icons']}/>

## Validation
Ensure that the date range picker is properly filled out by using the `isRequired` prop.

## Custom Validation
Use the `validate` function to implement custom validation rules. It evaluates the current date range and returns error messages if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

## Controlled
Take control of your date range picker by passing a `value` prop to manage the selected date range.

When the date range picker is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and is visually represented in a disabled state.
