## Recharts
The [Chart](/docs/components/surfaces/chart) component uses [Recharts](https://recharts.org/). Add `react-is` in the overrides section of your `package.json` as shown below:

```
"overrides": {
  "react-is": "19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106"
}
```

<Note intent='warning'>
  Ensure the `react-is` version matches your React version. For instance, in this project, React is at `19.0.0-rc-02c0e824-20241028`, so `react-is` should be the same version.
</Note>

## Framer Motion
Components like [Tabs](/docs/components/navigation/tabs), [Drawer](/docs/components/overlays/drawer), and [Progress Bar](/docs/components/statuses/progress-bar) use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations. If you're working with React 19, install `framer-motion@12.0.0-alpha.1`.
